# House Robber

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house
has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from
robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and
**it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken
into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each
house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without
alerting the police**.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> nums = [1,2,3,1]
<b>Output:</b> 4
<b>Explanation:</b> Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
<b>Output:</b> 12
<b>Explanation:</b> Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
</pre>

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= nums.length <= 100`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 400`

## Solution

```scala
object Solution {
    def rob(nums: Array[Int]): Int = {
        val memoized = scala.collection.mutable.HashMap[Int, Int]()

        def go(i: Int): Int =
            if (i > nums.length - 1) 0
            else memoized.getOrElseUpdate(i, nums(i) + maxRob(i + 2))

        def maxRob(i: Int): Int =
            Math.max(go(i), go(i + 1))

        maxRob(0)
    }
}
```
