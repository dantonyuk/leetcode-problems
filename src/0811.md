# Subdomain Visit Count

A website domain like "discuss.leetcode.com" consists of various
subdomains. At the top level, we have "com", at the next level, we have
"leetcode.com", and at the lowest level, "discuss.leetcode.com". When we
visit a domain like "discuss.leetcode.com", we will also visit the
parent domains "leetcode.com" and "com" implicitly.

Now, call a "count-paired domain" to be a count (representing the number
of visits this domain received), followed by a space, followed by the
address. An example of a count-paired domain might be "9001
discuss.leetcode.com".

We are given a list `cpdomains` of count-paired domains. We would like a
list of count-paired domains, (in the same format as the input, and in
any order), that explicitly counts the number of visits to each
subdomain.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
["9001 discuss.leetcode.com"]
<b>Output:</b>
["9001 discuss.leetcode.com", "9001 leetcode.com", "9001 com"]
<b>Explanation:</b>
We only have one website domain: "discuss.leetcode.com". As discussed
above, the subdomain "leetcode.com" and "com" will also be visited. So
they will all be visited 9001 times.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
["900 google.mail.com", "50 yahoo.com", "1 intel.mail.com", "5 wiki.org"]
<b>Output:</b>
["901 mail.com","50 yahoo.com","900 google.mail.com","5 wiki.org","5 org","1 intel.mail.com","951 com"]
<b>Explanation:</b>
We will visit "google.mail.com" 900 times, "yahoo.com" 50 times,
"intel.mail.com" once and "wiki.org" 5 times. For the subdomains, we
will visit "mail.com" 900 + 1 = 901 times, "com" 900 + 50 + 1 = 951
times, and "org" 5 times.
</pre>

**Notes:**

* The length of `cpdomains` will not exceed `100`.
* The length of each domain name will not exceed `100`.
* Each address will have either 1 or 2 "." characters.
* The input count in any count-paired domain will not exceed `10000`.
* The answer output can be returned in any order.

## Solution

```scala
object Solution {
    private val countPairedDomain = raw"(\d+) ([^.]+\.([^.]+(?:\.([^.]+))?))".r

    def toExplicitVisits(cpdomain: String) = cpdomain match {
        case countPairedDomain(visits, domains @ _*) =>
            domains
                .filter(_ != null)
                .map(domain => (domain, visits.toInt))
    }

    def subdomainVisits(cpdomains: Array[String]): List[String] =
        cpdomains.view
            .flatMap(toExplicitVisits)
            .groupMapReduce(_._1)(_._2)(_ + _)
            .map { case (domain, visits) => s"$visits $domain" }
            .toList
}
```
