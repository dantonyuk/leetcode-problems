# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Say you have an array for which the _i_<sup>th</sup> element is the price of a
given stock on day _i_.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one
and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum
profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

**Example 1:**

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> [7,1,5,3,6,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> 5
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> [7,6,4,3,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
</pre>

## Solution

```scala
object Solution {
    def maxProfit(prices: Array[Int]): Int = {
        val maxs = prices.view.scanRight(Int.MinValue)(Math.max).init
        val mins = prices.view.scanLeft(Int.MaxValue)(Math.min).tail

        (maxs lazyZip mins).map(_ - _).maxOption.getOrElse(0)
    }
}
```
