# Count Items Matching a Rule

You are given an array `items`, where each <code>items[i] =
[type<sub>i</sub>, color<sub>i</sub>, name<sub>i</sub>]</code> describes
the type, color, and name of the <code>i<sub>th</sub></code> item. You
are also given a rule represented by two strings, `ruleKey` and
`ruleValue`.

The <code>i<sub>th</sub></code> item is said to match the rule if
**one** of the following is true:

* `ruleKey == "type"` and <code>ruleValue == type<sub>i</sub></code>.
* `ruleKey == "color"` and <code>ruleValue == color<sub>i</sub></code>.
* `ruleKey == "name"` and <code>ruleValue == name<sub>i</sub></code>.

Return _the number of items that match the given rule_.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]],
ruleKey = "color", ruleValue = "silver"
<b>Output:</b> 1
<b>Explanation:</b> There is only one item matching the given rule, which is ["computer","silver","lenovo"].
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","phone"],["phone","gold","iphone"]],
ruleKey = "type", ruleValue = "phone"
<b>Output:</b> 2
<b>Explanation:</b> There are only two items matching the given rule, which are
["phone","blue","pixel"] and ["phone","gold","iphone"].
Note that the item ["computer","silver","phone"] does not match.
</pre>

**Constraints:**

* <code>1 <= items.length <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
* <code>1 <= type<sub>i</sub>.length, color<sub>i</sub>.length, name<sub>i</sub>.length, ruleValue.length <= 10</code>
* `ruleKey` is equal to either `"type",` `"color",` or `"name"`.
* All strings consist only of lowercase letters.

## Solution

```scala
object Solution {
    def countMatches(items: List[List[String]], ruleKey: String, ruleValue: String): Int = {
        val index = Array("type", "color", "name").indexOf(ruleKey)
        items.count(_(index) == ruleValue)
    }
}
```
