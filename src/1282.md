# Group the People Given the Group Size They Belong To

There are `n` people that are split into some unknown number of groups.
Each person is labeled with a **unique ID** from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given an integer array `groupSizes`, where `groupSizes[i]` is
the size of the group that person i is in. For example, if
`groupSizes[1] = 3`, then person `1` must be in a group of size `3`.

Return _a list of groups such that each person `i` is in a group of size
`groupSizes[i]`_.

Each person should appear in **exactly one group**, and every person
must be in a group. If there are multiple answers, **return any of
them**. It is **guaranteed** that there will be **at least one** valid
solution for the given input.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> groupSizes = [3,3,3,3,3,1,3]
<b>Output:</b> [[5],[0,1,2],[3,4,6]]
<b>Explanation:</b>
The first group is [5]. The size is 1, and groupSizes[5] = 1.
The second group is [0,1,2]. The size is 3, and groupSizes[0] = groupSizes[1] = groupSizes[2] = 3.
The third group is [3,4,6]. The size is 3, and groupSizes[3] = groupSizes[4] = groupSizes[6] = 3.
Other possible solutions are [[2,1,6],[5],[0,4,3]] and [[5],[0,6,2],[4,3,1]].
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> groupSizes = [2,1,3,3,3,2]
<b>Output:</b> [[1],[0,5],[2,3,4]]
</pre>

**Constraints:**

* `groupSizes.length == n`
* `1 <= n <= 500`
* `1 <= groupSizes[i] <= n`

## Solution

```scala
object Solution {
  def groupThePeople(groupSizes: Array[Int]): List[List[Int]] = {
    val groups = groupSizes.view.zipWithIndex.groupMap(_._1)(_._2)
    val result = for ((k, vs) <- groups; g <- vs.grouped(k)) yield g
    result.map(_.toList).toList
  }
}
```

One-liner solution

```scala
object Solution {
    def groupThePeople(groupSizes: Array[Int]): List[List[Int]] =
        groupSizes.view
            .zipWithIndex
            .groupMap(_._1)(_._2)
            .flatMap { case (k, vs) => vs.grouped(k) }
            .map(_.toList).toList
}
```
