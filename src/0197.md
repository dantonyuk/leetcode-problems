# Rising Temperature

<details><summary>SQL Schema</summary>

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Weather (Id int, RecordDate date, Temperature int)
Truncate table Weather
insert into Weather (Id, RecordDate, Temperature) values ('1', '2015-01-01', '10')
insert into Weather (Id, RecordDate, Temperature) values ('2', '2015-01-02', '25')
insert into Weather (Id, RecordDate, Temperature) values ('3', '2015-01-03', '20')
insert into Weather (Id, RecordDate, Temperature) values ('4', '2015-01-04', '30')
```
</details>

Given a `Weather` table, write a SQL query to find all dates' Ids with higher
temperature compared to its previous (yesterday's) dates.

```
+---------+------------------+------------------+
| Id(INT) | RecordDate(DATE) | Temperature(INT) |
+---------+------------------+------------------+
|       1 |       2015-01-01 |               10 |
|       2 |       2015-01-02 |               25 |
|       3 |       2015-01-03 |               20 |
|       4 |       2015-01-04 |               30 |
+---------+------------------+------------------+
```

For example, return the following Ids for the above `Weather` table:

```
+----+
| Id |
+----+
|  2 |
|  4 |
+----+
```

## Solution

Using window functions:

```sql
select Id from (
  select Id,
         Temperature - lag(Temperature) over w as TempDiff,
         datediff(RecordDate, lag(RecordDate) over w) as DateDiff
  from Weather window w as (order by RecordDate)
) q
where TempDiff > 0 and DateDiff = 1
```
