# Richest Customer Wealth

You are given an `m x n` integer grid `accounts` where `accounts[i][j]` is the
amount of money the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> customer has in the
<code>i<sup>th</sup></code> bank. Return the _**wealth** that the richest
customer has_.

A customer's **wealth** is the amount of money they have in all their bank
accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum
**wealth**.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
<b>Output:</b> 6
<b>Explanation:</b>
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
<b>Output:</b> 10
<b>Explanation:</b>
1st customer has wealth = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 10
3rd customer has wealth = 8
The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.
</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]
<b>Output:</b> 17
</pre>

**Constraints:**

* `m == accounts.length`
* `n == accounts[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 50`
* `1 <= accounts[i][j] <= 100`
