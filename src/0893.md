# Groups of Special-Equivalent Strings

You are given an array `A` of strings.

A _move onto `S`_ consists of swapping any two even indexed characters
of `S`, or any two odd indexed characters of `S`.

Two strings `S` and `T` are special-equivalent if after any number of
moves onto `S`, `S == T`.

For example, `S = "zzxy"` and `T = "xyzz"` are special-equivalent
because we may make the moves `"zzxy" -> "xzzy" -> "xyzz"` that swap
`S[0]` and `S[2]`, then `S[1]` and `S[3]`.

Now, a _group of special-equivalent strings from `A`_ is a non-empty
subset of A such that:

1. Every pair of strings in the group are special equivalent, and;
2. The group is the largest size possible (ie., there isn't a string S
   not in the group such that S is special equivalent to every string in
   the group)

Return the number of groups of special-equivalent strings from `A`.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: ["abcd","cdab","cbad","xyzz","zzxy","zzyx"]
<b>Output</b>: 3
<b>Explanation</b>:
One group is ["abcd", "cdab", "cbad"], since they are all pairwise special equivalent,
and none of the other strings are all pairwise special equivalent to these.

The other two groups are ["xyzz", "zzxy"] and ["zzyx"].
Note that in particular, "zzxy" is not special equivalent to "zzyx".
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: ["abc","acb","bac","bca","cab","cba"]
<b>Output</b>: 3
</pre>

**Note:**

* `1 <= A.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= A[i].length <= 20`
* All `A[i]` have the same length.
* All `A[i]` consist of only lowercase letters.

## Solution

```scala
object Solution {
    def numSpecialEquivGroups(A: Array[String]): Int = {
        def special(s: String) = {
            val grouped = s.zipWithIndex.groupMap(_._2 % 2)(_._1)
            def charSet(key: Int) =
                grouped.getOrElse(key, List.empty).sorted.mkString
            (charSet(0), charSet(1))
        }

        A.groupBy(special).size
    }
}
```
