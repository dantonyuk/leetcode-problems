# Find Common Characters

Given an array `A` of strings made only from lowercase letters, return a
list of all characters that show up in all strings within the list
**(including duplicates)**.  For example, if a character occurs 3 times
in all strings but not 4 times, you need to include that character three
times in the final answer.

You may return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> ["bella","label","roller"]
<b>Output:</b> ["e","l","l"]
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> ["cool","lock","cook"]
<b>Output:</b> ["c","o"]
</pre>

**Note:**

* `1 <= A.length <= 100`
* `1 <= A[i].length <= 100`
* `A[i][j]` is a lowercase letter
