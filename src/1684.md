# Count the Number of Consistent Strings

You are given a string `allowed` consisting of **distinct** characters
and an array of strings `words`. A string is **consistent** if all
characters in the string appear in the string `allowed`.

Return _the number of **consistent** strings in the array_ `words`.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> allowed = "ab", words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]
<b>Output:</b> 2
<b>Explanation:</b> Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only
contain characters 'a' and 'b'.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> allowed = "abc", words = ["a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"]
<b>Output:</b> 7
<b>Explanation:</b> All strings are consistent.
</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> allowed = "cad", words =
["cc","acd","b","ba","bac","bad","ac","d"]
<b>Output:</b> 4
<b>Explanation:</b> Strings "cc", "acd", "ac", and "d" are consistent.
</pre>

Constraints:

* <code>1 <= words.length <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
* `1 <= allowed.length <= 26`
* `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
* The characters in `allowed` are **distinct**.
* `words[i]` and `allowed` contain only lowercase English letters.

## Solution

```scala
object Solution {
    def countConsistentStrings(allowed: String, words: Array[String]): Int = {
        val isAllowed = allowed.toSet
        words.count(_.forall(isAllowed))
    }
}
```
