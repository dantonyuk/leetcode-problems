# Remove Palindromic Subsequences

You are given a string `s` consisting **only** of letters `'a'` and
`'b'`. In a single step you can remove one **palindromic subsequence**
from `s`.

Return _the **minimum** number of steps to make the given string empty_.

A string is a **subsequence** of a given string if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order. Note that a subsequence does **not** necessarily need to be contiguous.

A string is called **palindrome** if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input: s = "ababa"</b>
<b>Output: 1</b>
<b>Explanation: s is already a palindrome, so its entirety can be removed in a single step.</b>
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input: s = "abb"</b>
<b>Output: 2</b>
<b>Explanation: "abb" -> "bb" -> "".</b>
Remove palindromic subsequence "a" then "bb".
</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
<b>Input: s = "baabb"</b>
<b>Output: 2</b>
<b>Explanation: "baabb" -> "b" -> "".</b>
Remove palindromic subsequence "baab" then "b".
</pre>

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `s[i]` is either `'a'` or `'b'`.
