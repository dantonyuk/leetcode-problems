# Lucky Numbers in a Matrix

Given a `m * n` matrix of **distinct** numbers, return all lucky numbers
in the matrix in **any** order.

A lucky number is an element of the matrix such that it is the minimum
element in its row and maximum in its column.

Example 1:
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: matrix = [[3,7,8],[9,11,13],[15,16,17]]
<b>Output</b>: [15]
<b>Explanation</b>: 15 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column
</pre>

Example 2:
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: matrix = [[1,10,4,2],[9,3,8,7],[15,16,17,12]]
<b>Output</b>: [12]
<b>Explanation</b>: 12 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column.
</pre>

Example 3:
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: matrix = [[7,8],[1,2]]
<b>Output</b>: [7]
</pre>

Constraints:

* `m == mat.length`
* `n == mat[i].length`
* `1 <= n, m <= 50`
* <code>1 <= matrix[i][j] <= 10<sup>5</sup>.</code>
* All elements in the matrix are distinct.

## Solution

```scala
object Solution {
    def luckyNumbers (matrix: Array[Array[Int]]): List[Int] = {
        (for (
            row <- matrix.view;
            val (el, idx) = row.view.zipWithIndex.minBy(_._1);
            if matrix.forall(row => row(idx) <= el)
        ) yield el).toList
    }
}
```
