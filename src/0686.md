# Repeated String Match

Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be
repeated such that B is a substring of it. If no such solution, return -1.

For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab".

Return 3, because by repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a substring
of it; and B is not a substring of A repeated two times ("abcdabcd").

**Note:**

The length of `A` and `B` will be between 1 and 10000.

## Solution

```scala
object Solution {
    def repeatedStringMatch(A: String, B: String): Int = {
        if (A.contains(B)) 1
        else if ((A + A).contains(B)) 2
        else {
            val times = B.length / A.length + (if (B.length % A.length == 0) 0 else 1)
            if ((A * times).contains(B)) times
            else if ((A * (times + 1)).contains(B)) times + 1
            else -1
        }
    }
}
```
