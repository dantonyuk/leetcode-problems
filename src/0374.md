# Guess Number Higher or Lower

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from _1_ to _n_. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API `guess(int num)` which returns 3 possible results (`-1`, `1`, or `0`):

```
-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
```

**Example :**
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: n = 10, pick = 6
<b>Output</b>: 6
</pre>

## Solution

```scala
/**
 * The API guess is defined in the parent class.
 * @param  num   your guess
 * @return 	     -1 if num is lower than the guess number
 *			      1 if num is higher than the guess number
 *               otherwise return 0
 * def guess(num: Int): Int = {}
 */

class Solution extends GuessGame {
    def guessNumber(n: Int): Int = {
        var (lo, hi) = (1, n)
        while (lo < hi) {
            var mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2
            guess(mid) match {
                case -1 => hi = mid - 1
                case  1 => lo = mid + 1
                case  0 => return mid
            }
        }
        throw new IllegalStateException("unreachable")
    }
}
```
