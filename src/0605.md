# Can Place Flowers

Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and
some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would
compete for water and both would die.

Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number **n**, return if **n** new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
<b>Output</b>: True
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
<b>Output</b>: False
</pre>

**Note:**

* The input array won't violate no-adjacent-flowers rule.
* The input array size is in the range of [1, 20000].
* **n** is a non-negative integer which won't exceed the input array size.

## Solution

```scala
object Solution {
    def canPlaceFlowers(flowerbed: Array[Int], n: Int): Boolean = {
        def groupCount(s: LazyList[Int]): LazyList[(Int, Int)] =
            if (s.isEmpty) LazyList()
            else {
                val (same, rest) = s.span(_ == s(0))
                (same(0), same.size) #:: groupCount(rest)
            }

        val groups = groupCount(LazyList.concat(Array(1, 0), flowerbed, Array(0, 1)))
        val max = groups.collect { case (0, c) => (c - 1) / 2 }.sum

        n >= 0 && n <= max
    }
}```
