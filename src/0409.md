# Longest Palindrome

Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the
length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.

This is case sensitive, for example `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.

**Note:**

Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1,010.

**Example:**
```
Input:
"abccccdd"

Output:
7

Explanation:
One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.

## Solution

```scala
object Solution {
    def longestPalindrome(s: String): Int = {
        val lettersCount = s.groupMapReduce(c => c)(c => 1)(_ + _).values.toArray
        val oddsCount = lettersCount.count(_ % 2 == 1)
        s.length - oddsCount + (if (oddsCount > 0) 1 else 0)
    }
}
```
