# Can Make Arithmetic Progression From Sequence

Given an array of numbers `arr`. A sequence of numbers is called an
arithmetic progression if the difference between any two consecutive
elements is the same.

Return `true` if the array can be rearranged to form an arithmetic
progression, otherwise, return `false`.

Example 1:

Input: arr = [3,5,1]
Output: true
Explanation: We can reorder the elements as [1,3,5] or [5,3,1] with differences 2 and -2 respectively, between each consecutive elements.

Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2,4]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to reorder the elements to obtain an arithmetic progression.

 

Constraints:

* `2 <= arr.length <= 1000`
* <code>-10<sup>6</sup> <= arr[i] <= 10<sup>6</sup></code>

## Solution

```scala
object Solution {
    def canMakeArithmeticProgression(arr: Array[Int]): Boolean = {
        val (min, max) = (arr.min, arr.max)
        ((max - min) % (arr.length - 1) == 0) && {
            val step = (max - min) / (arr.length - 1)
            (step == 0) || Range.inclusive(min, max, step).forall(arr.toSet)
        }
    }
}
