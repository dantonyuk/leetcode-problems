# String Matching in an Array

Given an array of string `words`. Return all strings in `words` which is
substring of another word in *any* order. 

String `words[i]` is substring of `words[j],` if can be obtained
removing some characters to left and/or right side of `words[j]`.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: words = ["mass","as","hero","superhero"]
<b>Output</b>: ["as","hero"]
<b>Explanation</b>: "as" is substring of "mass" and "hero" is substring of "superhero".
["hero","as"] is also a valid answer.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: words = ["leetcode","et","code"]
<b>Output</b>: ["et","code"]
<b>Explanation</b>: "et", "code" are substring of "leetcode".
</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: words = ["blue","green","bu"]
<b>Output</b>: []
</pre>

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= words.length <= 100`
* `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`
* `words[i]` contains only lowercase English letters.
* It's **guaranteed** that `words[i]` will be unique.

## Solution

By searching for the second occurrence:

```scala
object Solution {
    def stringMatching(words: Array[String]): List[String] = {
        val commaSepWords = words.mkString(",")
        val pos: (String, Int) => Int = commaSepWords.indexOf
        words.filter(word => pos(word, pos(word, 0) + 1) > 1).toList
    }
}
```

By matching a regex:

```scala
object Solution {
    def stringMatching(words: Array[String]): List[String] = {
        val matches = words.mkString(",").matches _
        words.filter(word => matches(s".*?($word).*?\\1.*")).toList
    }
}
```
