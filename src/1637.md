# Widest Vertical Area Between Two Points Containing No Points

Given `n` `points` on a 2D plane where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`, Return
_the **widest vertical area** between two points such that no points are
inside the area_.

A **vertical area** is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along
the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The **widest vertical area** is the
one with the maximum width.

Note that points **on the edge** of a vertical area **are not**
considered included in the area.

**Example 1:**
<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/19/points3.png" width="276" height="371">
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
<b>Output:</b> 1
<b>Explanation:</b> Both the red and the blue area are optimal.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]
<b>Output:</b> 3
</pre>

Constraints:

* `n == points.length`
* <code>2 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
* `points[i].length == 2`
* <code>0 <= xi, yi <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>

## Solution

```scala
object Solution {
    def maxWidthOfVerticalArea(points: Array[Array[Int]]): Int =
        points.view
            .map(_(0))
            .sorted
            .sliding(2, 1)
            .map(_.toArray)
            .map { case Array(l, r) => r - l }
            .max
}
```
