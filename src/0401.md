# Binary Watch

A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the **hours**
(**0-11**), and the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the **minutes**
(**0-59**).

Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the
right.

For example, the above binary watch reads "3:25".

Given a non-negative integer n which represents the number of LEDs that
are currently on, return all possible times the watch could represent.

**Example:**
```
Input: n = 1
Return: ["1:00", "2:00", "4:00", "8:00", "0:01", "0:02", "0:04", "0:08", "0:16", "0:32"]
```

**Note:**

* The order of output does not matter.
* The hour must not contain a leading zero, for example "01:00" is not
  valid, it should be "1:00".
* The minute must be consist of two digits and may contain a leading
  zero, for example "10:2" is not valid, it should be "10:02".

## Solution

```scala
object Solution {
    private val CACHE =
        (for (
            h <- LazyList.range(0, 12);
            m <- LazyList.range(0, 60)
         ) yield (Integer.bitCount(h << 6 | m), "%s:%02d".format(h, m))
        ).groupMap(_._1)(_._2)

    def readBinaryWatch(num: Int): List[String] =
        CACHE.getOrElse(num, List.empty).toList
}
```
