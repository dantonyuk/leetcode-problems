# Merge Strings Alternately

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by
adding letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. If a string
is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of
the merged string.

Return _the merged string_.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
<b>Output:</b> "apbqcr"
<b>Explanation:</b> The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
<b>Output:</b> "apbqrs"
<b>Explanation:</b> Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
<b>Output:</b> "apbqcd"
<b>Explanation:</b> Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q
merged: a p b q c   d
</pre>

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100`
* `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

```scala
object Solution {
    def mergeAlternately(word1: String, word2: String): String = {
        def merge(index: Int): LazyList[Char] = {
            val hasNext1 = index < word1.length
            val hasNext2 = index < word2.length
            (hasNext1, hasNext2) match {
                case (false, false) =>
                    LazyList.empty
                case (false, true)  =>
                    word2.substring(index).to(LazyList)
                case (true, false)  =>
                    word1.substring(index).to(LazyList)
                case (true, true)   =>
                    word1(index) #:: word2(index) #:: merge(index + 1)
            }
        }

        merge(0).mkString
    }
}
```
