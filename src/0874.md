# Walking Robot Simulation

A robot on an infinite grid starts at point (0, 0) and faces north.  The robot
can receive one of three possible types of commands:

* `-2`: turn left 90 degrees
* `-1`: turn right 90 degrees
* `1 <= x <= 9`: move forward x units

Some of the grid squares are obstacles. 

The `i`-th obstacle is at grid point (`obstacles[i][0]`, `obstacles[i][1]`)

If the robot would try to move onto them, the robot stays on the previous grid
square instead (but still continues following the rest of the route.)

Return the **square** of the maximum Euclidean distance that the robot will be
from the origin.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: commands = [4,-1,3], obstacles = []
<b>Output</b>: 25
<b>Explanation</b>: robot will go to (3, 4)
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: commands = [4,-1,4,-2,4], obstacles = [[2,4]]
<b>Output</b>: 65
<b>Explanation</b>: robot will be stuck at (1, 4) before turning left and going to (1, 8)
</pre>

Note:

1. `0 <= commands.length <= 10000`
1. `0 <= obstacles.length <= 10000`
1. `-30000 <= obstacle[i][0] <= 30000`
1. `-30000 <= obstacle[i][1] <= 30000`
1. The answer is guaranteed to be less than <code>2<sup>31</sup></code>.

## Solution

```scala
object Solution {
    def robotSim(commands: Array[Int], obstacles: Array[Array[Int]]): Int = {
        val obstacleSet = obstacles.view.map { case Array(x, y) => (x, y) }.toSet
        var position = (0, 0)
        var direction = (0, 1)
        var maxDistance = 0

        commands.foreach {
            case -1 =>
                direction = (direction._2, direction._1 * -1)
            case -2 =>
                direction = (direction._2 * -1, direction._1)
            case command if command >= 1 && command <= 9 =>
                position = (1 to command).foldLeft(position)((pos, _) => {
                    val next = (pos._1 + direction._1, pos._2 + direction._2)
                    if (obstacleSet(next)) pos else next
                })
                maxDistance = Math.max(maxDistance,
                   position._1 * position._1 + position._2 * position._2)
        }
        
        maxDistance
    }
}
```
