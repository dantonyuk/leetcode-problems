# Delete Duplicate Emails

Write a SQL query to **delete** all duplicate email entries in a table named
`Person`, keeping only unique emails based on its _smallest_ **Id**.

```
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Id is the primary key column for this table.
```

For example, after running your query, the above `Person` table should have the
following rows:

```
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
```

**Note:**

Your output is the whole `Person` table after executing your sql. Use `delete`
statement.
