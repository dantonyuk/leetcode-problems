# Reverse String

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `char[]`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of [printable ascii characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
<b>Output</b>: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
<b>Output</b>: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
</pre>

## Solution

```scala
object Solution {
    def reverseString(s: Array[Char]): Unit = {
        for (i <- 0 to s.length / 2 - 1) {
            val tmp = s(i)
            s(i) = s(s.length - i - 1)
            s(s.length - i - 1) = tmp
        }
    }
}
```
