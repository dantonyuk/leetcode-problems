# Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range

Given two non-negative integers `low` and `high`. Return the _count of odd
numbers between_ `low` and `high` (inclusive).

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: low = 3, high = 7
<b>Output</b>: 3
<b>Explanation</b>: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: low = 8, high = 10
<b>Output</b>: 1
<b>Explanation</b>: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].
</pre>

Constraints:

* <code>0 <= low <= high <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
