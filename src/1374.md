# Generate a String With Characters That Have Odd Counts

Given an integer `n`, <i>return a string with <code>n</code> characters
such that each character in such string occurs <b>an odd number of
times</b></i>.

The returned string must contain only lowercase English letters. If
there are multiples valid strings, return **any** of them.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: n = 4
<b>Output</b>: "pppz"
<b>Explanation</b>: "pppz" is a valid string since the character 'p'
             occurs three times and the character 'z' occurs once.
             Note that there are many other valid strings such as
             "ohhh" and "love".
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: n = 2
<b>Output</b>: "xy"
<b>Explanation</b>: "xy" is a valid string since the characters
             'x' and 'y' occur once. Note that there are many other
             valid strings such as "ag" and "ur".
</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: n = 7
<b>Output</b>: "holasss"
</pre>

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 500`
