# Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String

Given a string `S` of lowercase letters, a _duplicate removal_ consists
of choosing two adjacent and equal letters, and removing them.

We repeatedly make duplicate removals on S until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been
made.  It is guaranteed the answer is unique.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> "abbaca"
<b>Output:</b> "ca"
<b>Explanation:</b>
For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are
adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move.  The result
of this move is that the string is "aaca", of which only "aa" is
possible, so the final string is "ca".
</pre>

**Note:**

* `1 <= S.length <= 20000`
* `S` consists only of English lowercase letters.

## Solution

Using regular expressions:

```scala
object Solution {
    def removeDuplicates(S: String): String = {
        def step(s: String) = s.replaceAll("(.)\\1", "")

        var current = S
        var next = step(S)
        while (next != current) {
            current = next
            next = step(current)
        }

        current
    }
}
```

Folding in Stack

```scala
object Solution {
    def removeDuplicates(S: String): String =
        S.foldRight(List.empty[Char]) {
            case (c, x::xs) if c == x => xs
            case (c, xs) => c :: xs
        }.mkString
}
```
