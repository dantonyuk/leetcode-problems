# Shortest Distance to a Character

Given a string `s` and a character `c` that occurs in `s`, return _an
array of integers_ `answer` where `answer.length == s.length` and
answer[i] is the **distance** from index `i` to the **closest**
_occurrence of character_ `c` in `s`.

The **distance** between two indices `i` and `j` is `abs(i - j)`, where
`abs` is the absolute value function.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> s = "loveleetcode", c = "e"
<b>Output:</b> [3,2,1,0,1,0,0,1,2,2,1,0]
<b>Explanation:</b> The character 'e' appears at indices 3, 5, 6, and 11 (0-indexed).
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 0 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(0 - 3) = 3.
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 1 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(1 - 3) = 3.
For index 4, there is a tie between the 'e' at index 3 and the 'e' at index 5,
but the distance is still the same: abs(4 - 3) == abs(4 - 5) = 1.
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 8 is at index 6, so the distance is abs(8 - 6) = 2.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> s = "aaab", c = "b"
<b>Output:</b> [3,2,1,0]
</pre>

**Constraints:**

* <code>1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
* `s[i]` and `c` are lowercase English letters.
* It is guaranteed that `c` occurs at least once in `s`.

## Solution

```scala
object Solution {
    def shortestToChar(s: String, c: Char): Array[Int] = {
        val indexedChars = s.to(LazyList).zipWithIndex
        val indexes = for ((x, i) <- indexedChars if x == c) yield i

        val result = Array.ofDim[Int](s.length)

        var current = indexes(0)
        for (i <- 0 to current) {
            result(i) = current - i
        }

        for (next <- indexes.tail) {
            val middle = (current + next) / 2
            for (i <- (current + 1) to middle) {
                result(i) = i - current
            }
            for (i <- (middle + 1) to next) {
                result(i) = next - i
            }
            current = next
        }

        current = indexes.last
        for (i <- current to (s.length - 1)) {
            result(i) = i - current
        }

        result
    }
