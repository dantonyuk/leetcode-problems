# Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero

Given a non-negative integer `num`, return the number of steps to reduce
it to zero. If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2,
otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: num = 14
<b>Output</b>: 6
<b>Explanation</b>:
Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7.
Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3.
Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2.
Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1.
Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: num = 8
<b>Output</b>: 4
<b>Explanation</b>:
Step 1) 8 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 4.
Step 2) 4 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 2.
Step 3) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1.
Step 4) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: num = 123
<b>Output</b>: 12
</pre>

**Constraints:**

* <code>0 <= num <= 10<sup>6</sup></code>

## Solution

Straightforward solution:

```scala
object Solution {
    def numberOfSteps (num: Int): Int = {
        var steps = 0
        var n = num
        while (n != 0) {
            if (n % 2 == 0) n /= 2 else n -= 1
            steps += 1
        }
        steps
    }
}
```

Using prebuilt bit numbers:

```scala
object Solution {
    val bitNumbers = LazyList.iterate(1, 21)(_ << 1).zipWithIndex.toMap

    def numberOfSteps (num: Int): Int =
        if (num == 0) 0
        else bitNumbers(Integer.highestOneBit(num)) + Integer.bitCount(num)
}
```

Using binary representation:

```scala
object Solution {
    def numberOfSteps (num: Int): Int = {
        val s = num.toBinaryString
        s.length + s.count(_ == '1') - 1
    }
}
```
