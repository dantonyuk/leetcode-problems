# Two Sum II - Input array is sorted

Given an array of integers that is already **_sorted in ascending order_**,
find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add
up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

**Note:**

* Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
* You may assume that each input would have _exactly_ one solution and you may
  not use the _same_ element twice.

**Example:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
<b>Output:</b> [1,2]
<b>Explanation:</b> The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
</pre>

## Solution

```scala
object Solution {
    def twoSum(numbers: Array[Int], target: Int): Array[Int] = {
        var (l, r) = (0, numbers.length - 1)
        def sum = numbers(l) + numbers(r)

        while (l <= r && sum != target) {
            while (sum > target) r -= 1
            while (sum < target) l += 1
        }

        Array(l + 1, r + 1)
    }
}
```
