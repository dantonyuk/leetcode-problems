# Minimum Time Visiting All Points

On a plane there are `n` points with integer coordinates `points[i] = [xi,
yi]`. Your task is to find the minimum time in seconds to visit all points.

You can move according to the next rules:

* In one second always you can either move vertically, horizontally by one unit or diagonally (it means to move one unit vertically and one unit horizontally in one second).
* You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.

**Example 1:**

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/14/1626_example_1.PNG" width="500" height="428">

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> points = [[1,1],[3,4],[-1,0]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 7
<strong>Explanation:</strong> One optimal path is <strong>[1,1]</strong> ->
[2,2] -> [3,3] -> <strong>[3,4] </strong>-> [2,3] -> [1,2] -> [0,1] ->
<strong>[-1,0]</strong> Time from [1,1] to [3,4] = 3 seconds Time from [3,4] to
[-1,0] = 4 seconds Total time = 7 seconds
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> points = [[3,2],[-2,2]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 5
</pre>

**Constraints:**

* `points.length == n`
* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `points[i].length == 2`
* `-1000 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 1000`

## Solution

```scala
object Solution {
  def distance(p1: Array[Int], p2: Array[Int]) = {
    val x = Math.abs(p1(0) - p2(0))
    val y = Math.abs(p1(1) - p2(1))
    Math.min(x, y) + Math.abs(x - y)
  }

  def minTimeToVisitAllPoints(points: Array[Array[Int]]): Int =
    if (points == null || points.isEmpty) 0
    else points.lazyZip(points.tail).map(distance).sum
}
```
