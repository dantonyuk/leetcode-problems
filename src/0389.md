# Find the Difference

Given two strings _**s**_ and _**t**_ which consist of only lowercase letters.

String _**t**_ is generated by random shuffling string _**s**_ and then add one
more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in _**t**_.

**Example:**
```
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
```

## Solution

Counting all the letters:

```scala
object Solution {
    def findTheDifference(s: String, t: String): Char = {
        val lettersCount = Array.ofDim[Int](26)
        t.foreach(c => lettersCount(c - 'a') += 1)
        s.foreach(c => lettersCount(c - 'a') -= 1)
        ('a' + lettersCount.indexOf(1)).toChar
    }
}
```

Using `xor`:

```scala
object Solution {
    def findTheDifference(s: String, t: String): Char =
        (s + t).map(_.toInt).reduce(_ ^ _).toChar
}
```

Difference of two sums:

```scala
object Solution {
    def findTheDifference(s: String, t: String): Char =
        (t.sum - s.sum).toChar
}
```

Using `String::diff`

```scala
object Solution {
    def findTheDifference(s: String, t: String): Char =
        (t diff s)(0)
}
```
